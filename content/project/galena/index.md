title: "GALENA"
summary: Devices’ authentication is one of the key requirements to provide security in IoT environments. However, current Adaptative Authentication Systems (AAS) employ adaptation factors in an isolated way and ignore the correlation between them, as well as the relations that the devices build in the contexts where they are located. Those AASs show themselves as rigid about the most compatible mechanisms in one given context and do not provide multi-factor adaptation. This work proposes GALENA as an adaptive authentication management system in IoT networks, based on social trust strategies, devices’ context, and policies. The GALENA evaluation showed its efficiency in adapting and selecting the authentication mechanism appropriated for each interaction

Devices’ authentication is one of the key requirements to provide security in IoT environments. However, current Adaptative Authentication Systems (AAS) employ adaptation factors in an isolated way and ignore the correlation between them, as well as the relations that the devices build in the contexts where they are located. Those AASs show themselves as rigid about the most compatible mechanisms in one given context and do not provide multi-factor adaptation. This work proposes GALENA ((mana**G**ement of **A**daptive authentication based on poLici**E**s a**N**d soci**A**l trust)) as an adaptive authentication management system in IoT networks, based on social trust strategies, devices’ context, and policies. The GALENA evaluation showed its efficiency in adapting and selecting the authentication mechanism appropriated for each interaction.
